            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180165:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 51 -->deteined, are much miſuſed. Therefore, both the equitie and the faithfulneſs of Roial Protection (on which our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects do repoſe their truſt and relief) requiring it, wee have therein diligently uſed our endeavors for the utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of ſuch damages and hinderances from our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Subjects thereof; Which troubles, as from the beginning of this dangerous War by Sea, between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> wee did eaſily fore-ſee ſhould happen to ſuch as go to Sea; ſo wee then uſed our due and provident care, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to remove the ſame, but further alſo wee freely and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly did ſtrive, by amicable waies, to quench the burning flames of that bloodie War. Moreover, as to this day wee have been willing carefully and ſincerely to maintein the amitie, which hath been of old between our Kingdom of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the Confederate and friendly States, ſo wee hope to have ſtill the ſame confidence of mutual amitie equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteined between them. And therefore, leaſt Wee, or our faithful Subjects, ſhould have that Character put upon us, as if, under pretence of amitie and free Navigation, wee would cover the ſhips and goods of one or the other of the two Common-wealths in enmitie, and thereby give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ſuſpitions objected to Us and our Subjects; by reaſon of which, many of our ſhips, not onely of ſuch as ſailed to any one of the ſaid reſpective Enemies, but alſo of ſuch as were bound for neutral places, have been interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And in particular, leaſt our ſhips and goods, and of our faithful Subjects, have reaſon to fear the violence and force either of the Pirats, or of the Frigots aforeſaid; Wee could finde no better, nor more convenient waie, to provide unto the ſincere integritie and ſecuritie of our ſaid ſhips, then by commanding a Squadron of our men of War to attend and remain in ſom of our Ports towards the Weſt, eſpecially at <hi>Gothemburg,</hi> which ſhall have a more accurate inſpection, for the preventing of all frauds; and accordingly ſhall law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defend, in their free courſ, all our ſhips and goods againſt all unjuſt attempts. For which end, and that this our deſign might bee the better ſignified and promoted, wee deſire that the under-written Articles might bee taken for a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180165:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 51 -->rule, by ſuch as are concerned therein; and do graciouſly command all ſuch as are bound to obey our will, to obſerv the ſame, without any kinde of neglect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our men of War, which upon occaſion ſhall bee by us appointed for the foreſaid Convoys, ſhall abide at <hi>Gothem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> or thereabouts; that, when required, they might bee ready to conduct, through the Weſtern Seas, the Merchant's ſhips, which ſhall com out of the <hi>Sound,</hi> and ſhall have need of their Convoy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When any Merchant-Ship ſhall com and deſire the ſaid Convoy, the ſame ſhall be ſtrictly viſited, leaſt any other Ships or goods, but ſuch as properly belong to our Subjects, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſuch as are neutral, might bee received under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our Convoys. For which end, all the Paſſes and Certificates of the Merchant's goods ſhall bee diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and a ſtrict inquirie made, by the Admiral, or the chief Commanders of the ſaid Convoys. And in particular if it happen's that ſom neutral Towns ſhall deſire their Ships and Goods to ſail under our Convoys, wee can ſee no ſufficient reaſon, why wee ſhould deny it: But yet in that caſe, they ſhall bee obliged to give full and ſufficient ſecuritie to our ſaid Convoys, by the Teſtimonial Letters of the Magiſtrates of the Towns, from whence they ſet forth, concerning the proprietie of the Ships and goods, leaſt, under the ſaid Ships and goods of the ſaid Towns, any fraud lie hid and covered; becauſ the Officers of our ſaid Men of War ſhall have ſuch a care, that if they meet at Sea with any Fleet, either great, or ſmall, they might have a cleer and ſincere anſwer to give them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If any be ſo bold, againſt this our ſevere Command, to abuſe any of our Convoys, thereby intending to cover his frauds, and the ſame, either preſently after, or afterwards in progreſs of time, ſhall happen to com to knowledg, the ſaid goods and wares, or their true value, without any mitigation, ſhall bee forfeited to us and to our Crown, if the ſaid goods, or the defrauder himſelf, or any part of his other goods, then, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereafter at any time, be found in our Kingdoms, Dominions, or Ports. And further, the Skipper, if hee bee convicted to have been conſcious of the fraud, ſo that hee bee not able to cleer himſelf of it, beſides the goods ſo concealed, ſhall loſe the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180165:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->part, hee may have in the Ship; or if hee hath none, then hee ſhall bee arreſted, until he redeem's himſelf with 500 crowns.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If our ſhips of Convoy do meet perchance with, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many, or few, or one Ship, of whatſoëver Nation they might bee, they ſhall bee bound to require nothing elſ of them, but good correſpondence; to declare all manner of friendſhip with any of them; and to take heed, not to give any lawful or juſt cauſ of miſ-underſtanding or quarrel. And wee are further content, that if any Fleet of men of War doth, in a juſt manner, require it of them, they might ſhew our Powers or Paſſes, and declare what Ships have been received under the protection of their Convoy. But, by all decent way, they ſhall decline, either to bee themſelvs, or any in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, particularly ſearched; but, as they are gon out with full ſecuritie, leſt any fraud ſhould bee concealed; ſo likewiſe wee deſire they might bee credited, that they might go on in their Voyages, without let or moleſtation, with all the Veſſels in their companie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If our Convoys meet with any Caper, and bee not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by him, they ſhall forbear to meddle with him. But, if they obſerv him to intend any violence, wee will have our Men of War diligently to mark from whence ſuch Caper did ſet forth, and then ſeriouſly to warn him of the debate and accuſation like to inſue before his own Magiſtrate. And if for all that hee doth not deſiſt, and if neceſſitie forceth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, Ours ſhall, as much as in them laie, by force repulſ violence, both from themſelves, and from their companie.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As wee finde that no lawful ſuſpition can bee had of our free Ships, when they are once paſt the Channel between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> ſo wee will not have our Men of War to conduct them farther then the Ports within the ſaid Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. In particular, for ſom ſpecial cauſes, wee will have our Men of War now at the begining, to direct ſpecially their Convoys to ſuch Ports, as are neutral in this War between <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> until wee do otherwiſe declare our minde thereupon: But yet ſo, as it might bee free to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Subjects to go either into <hi>England</hi> or into the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> to exerciſe their free Commerce, if without our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Convoy they will do it.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:180165:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->
7. When our Men of War ſhall have ſo ſafely brought the ſaid Merchant-Ships through the ſaid Channel, and left them in ſafetie, they ſhall indeavor forthwith to return to <hi>Gothem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg:</hi> Or, if there bee any Ship that bee willing to return into the Weſtern Seas, they ſhall exſpect them at <hi>Roſcow</hi> in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Brittany</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and having examined the ſame, after the waie before preſcribed, they ſhall bring them back again ſafe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That a more exact regard might bee had of the time when our Men of War ſhall bee bound to ſet forth from <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themburg</hi> for Convoys; Wee thought fit that at leaſt the ſame bee don once in a month, when there ſhall bee any Ship rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bee conducted. But otherwiſe whenſoëver 10 Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Ships ſhall bee ready at <hi>Gothemburg</hi> to bee convoyed, they ſhall do it without regarding the time. And in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, they ſhall obſerv this, that when the number of Merchant-Ships is leſs then 10, they onely ſhall want one Ship of Convoy; but if they bee above 10, to the number of 20, two Ships of Convoy ſhall bee granted them. And, if there bee yet more in number, the Admiral ſhall power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how many Convoys they ſhall have.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Becauſ hereby wee onely intend to provide to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of the navigation of our faithful Subjects; therefore our will is, that all ſuch as do inhabit our Dominions, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or Provinces, who are willing to enjoy the free navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation towards and through the Weſtern Seas to neutral places, ſhould forbear, during the preſent unſafetie at Sea, raſhly to go further then <hi>Gothemburg,</hi> but ſhould remain there and look for Convoys; that ſo much the better wee might undertake their protection. And if any, ſlighting this our gracious precaution, doth put himſelf in danger, hee is to exſpect to bee brought by us to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his temeritie.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Laſtly, that the charges required for the maintaining of our ſaid Men of War, bee not meerly and ſolely born by Us and our Crown, and yet not becom grievous to thoſe who ſhall make uſe of the ſaid Convoys, wee have thought good to impoſe a certain Tax, which wee will ſhortly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, with our gracious Command, that whoſoëver ſhall bee
